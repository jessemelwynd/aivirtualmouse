# aivirtualmouse
The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for the persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst of the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gesture and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera.
It is fair to say that the Virtual Mouse will soon to be substituting the traditional physical mouse in the near future, as people are aiming towards the lifestyle where that every technological devices can be controlled and interacted remotely without using any peripheral devices such as the remote, keyboards, etc. it doesn't just provides convenience, but it's cost effective as well.
